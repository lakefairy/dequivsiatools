*Explanation

        Gather the scattered keys and head to the goal.
        If you fall into a hole three times, the game is over.

        The erosion degree of a room indicates the number of hole
        rooms adjacent to the room.

        Hold A and use the cursor keys to guess hole locations.
        By releasing A, the selected room will be marked.


        If you feel the game boots slowly
        └Please move the "100" file from the "data" folder
         to the savedata folder.
         You'll avoid loading the music and be able to boot.

        dequivsia.en.15x.exe instead of dequivsia.en.exe. The 15x version
        lets you increase the scale factor up to 15x. Note that the scale
        selector isn't displayed correctly when set to 4x or more.
